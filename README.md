https://roadmap.sh/projects/server-stats

I tested this project on an Ubuntu system, though it should probably run on any system using bash.

Shows in order:
* Total CPU usage
* Total memory usage (Free vs Used single line)
* Total disk usage (Free vs Used single line)
* Top 5 processes by CPU
* Top 5 processes by memory


just download the file and run it with "bash server-stats.sh."
